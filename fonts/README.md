# BioData.pt Fonts

Have your needed custom webfonts locate them at this fonts folder.
List the files in the templates/includes/preload.twig file
Select if the preload is for all the site or LTR or RTL or per language.
Add the font-face definition files to the biodatapt/global-styles
 or biodatapt/global-styles-rtl libraries.

Other ways could be used to attach or add fonts in your sites.
This way is to have a better performance and code coverage.
